# Hi there 👋
I'm Software Engineer at Google DeepMind & Research and Teaching Assistant at MiNI faculty of Warsaw University of Technology. I specialise in Computer Graphics, VR, Computer Simulations and CAD/CAM Systems Design.

# MikCAD:
CAD software written in C# using WPF for GUI and OpenTK for visualization.\
Supported features and objects:
  - Creation and modification of:
    - Points,
    - Toruses,
    - Bézier curves:
      - C0,
      - C2,
      - Interpolating with C2 continuity,
    - Bézier surfaces:
      - C0,
      - Wrapped C0 (cylinder without base),
      - C2,
      - Wrapped C2 (cylinder without base),
  - Hole patching using Gregory patch,
  - Finding and displaying (in world and parameter space) intersection between following objects:
    - Bézier surfaces,
    - Toruses,  
  - Stereoscopy using colors,
  - Machine milling simulation using simplified G-code files:
    - flat and ball cutters with configurable radius,
    - error detection:
      - milling too deep,
      - milling down with flat cutter.
  - G-code generation for one provided model designed using this software.

# Side projects:
- Rewriting MikCAD in C++ and Vulkan,
- [Class library for graphs algorithms](https://github.com/WojcikMikolaj/GraphsLibrary) (C#, available on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mikwk.GraphLibrary/), on hold 😐:),
- [Home weather station/entertainment system](https://github.com/WojcikMikolaj/WeatherStation) based on RPi 4 and RPi zero (electronics + Python + Docker + Ansible + maybe C/C++, also on hold ☹️).

Some of my passions and things i like:
- :performing_arts:,
- :sailboat:,
- :tennis:,
- :ski:,
- 🧗,
- 📚,
- and more.
